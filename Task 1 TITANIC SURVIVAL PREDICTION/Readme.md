# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information on the passengers aboard the ill-fated voyage.

## Project Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction project involves building a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived or perished based on features such as age, gender, class, and other relevant attributes. This project is a classic example of binary classification in machine learning.

## Dataset
The dataset is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It consists of two CSV files:
- `train.csv`: The training set with labeled data (including the `Survived` column).
- `test.csv`: The test set without labels, which is used for model evaluation.

### Key Features:
- `PassengerId`: Unique ID for each passenger.
- `Survived`: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
- `Name`: Name of the passenger.
- `Sex`: Gender of the passenger.
- `Age`: Age of the passenger.
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings or spouses aboard.
- `Parch`: Number of parents or children aboard.
- `Ticket`: Ticket number.
- `Fare`: Passenger fare.
- `Cabin`: Cabin number.
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).

## Installation
To run this project locally, you need Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyter (optional, if running in a Jupyter notebook)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter

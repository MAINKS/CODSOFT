# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains the **Titanic Survival Prediction Model** developed during the **CodSoft Data Science Internship**. The project involves predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using various features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare.

## 📚 Project Overview

### 🎯 Objective
The aim of this project is to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This classic dataset is a great starting point for beginners in data science, offering insights into how different factors may have influenced the chances of survival.

### 🔑 Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive exploration of the Titanic dataset to understand the characteristics and relationships between features such as passenger class, age, gender, and fare.
- **Feature Engineering**: Techniques applied to clean and transform the data into a suitable format for model training.
- **Machine Learning Modeling**: Development of a classification model to predict passenger survival based on historical data.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to **CodSoft** for the opportunity to work on this project during the Data Science internship. The experience has been invaluable in enhancing my skills in data analysis and machine learning.

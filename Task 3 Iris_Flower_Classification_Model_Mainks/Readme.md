# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This repository contains the **Iris Flower Classification Model** developed during the **CodSoft Data Science Internship**. The project involves classifying iris flowers into three species—setosa, versicolor, and virginica—based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## 📚 Project Overview

### 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to train a machine learning model that can classify iris flowers into their respective species based on their measurements. The Iris dataset is a widely recognized dataset in the field of data science and is often used for introductory classification tasks.

### 🔑 Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: Detailed examination of the Iris dataset to understand the relationships between features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- **Feature Engineering**: Processing and transforming the raw data into a form suitable for model training.
- **Machine Learning Modeling**: Development of a classification model to accurately categorize iris flowers into one of the three species.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to **CodSoft** for the opportunity to work on this project during the Data Science internship. This experience has been pivotal in strengthening my understanding of classification techniques and data science practices.

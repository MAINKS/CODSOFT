**Data Science Projects - CodSoft Internship**

This repository contains a collection of data science projects completed as part of the CodSoft Data Science internship. The internship provided an excellent opportunity to apply data science techniques to real-world problems, and I'm grateful to CodSoft for enabling these projects.

Projects Overview
1. Titanic Survival Prediction
Objective: Build a model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not using the Titanic dataset. This project is a classic beginner task that involves working with data related to passengers' age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.
2. Movie Rating Prediction
Objective: Develop a model to predict movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors. This project involves data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques to estimate movie ratings accurately.
3. Iris Flower Classification
Objective: Create a classification model using the Iris dataset to categorize iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The model will classify flowers based on sepal and petal measurements.

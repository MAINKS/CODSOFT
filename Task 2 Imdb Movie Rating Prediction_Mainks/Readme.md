IMDb Movie Rating Prediction Model
This repository contains the IMDb Movie Rating Prediction Model developed during the CodSoft Data Science internship. The project focuses on predicting movie ratings based on various features like genre, director, and actors.

Project Overview
Objective
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates the IMDb ratings of movies. By analyzing historical movie data, the model aims to understand the factors influencing movie ratings and make accurate predictions based on the given features.

Key Features
Data Analysis: In-depth exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution and relationship of features.
Feature Engineering: Techniques applied to preprocess and transform raw data into meaningful input for the model.
Machine Learning Modeling: Implementation of regression techniques to build a predictive model capable of estimating movie ratings.
Tools and Technologies
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn

# 🎬 IMDb Movie Rating Prediction Model

This repository contains the **IMDb Movie Rating Prediction Model** developed as part of the **CodSoft Data Science Internship**. This project focuses on predicting movie ratings based on features such as genre, director, and actors.

## 📊 Project Overview

### 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates IMDb ratings of movies. By analyzing historical movie data, the model aims to understand the factors influencing movie ratings and make accurate predictions based on the given features.

### 🔑 Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: In-depth exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution and relationship of features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Techniques applied to preprocess and transform raw data into meaningful input for the model.
- **Machine Learning Modeling**: Implementation of regression techniques to build a predictive model capable of estimating movie ratings.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
